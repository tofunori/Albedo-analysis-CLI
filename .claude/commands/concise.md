---

Refactor the current code to be concise and well-structured while preserving the exact same functionality and pipeline. 

Improvements include:
- Remove redundant comments and verbose explanations
- Add only essential, clear comments where needed
- Optimize print statements for clarity
- Consolidate repetitive code patterns
- Improve variable naming for self-documenting code
- Maintain identical input/output behavior
- Keep the same processing pipeline and logic flow

The code will be more readable and maintainable while functioning exactly the same.
